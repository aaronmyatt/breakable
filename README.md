# breakable
A repo to house all of my dirty `Rails` breakable toy implementations
http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch05.html#breakable_toys

# Breakable Specs
+ Simple web app
+ Default authentication - login/registration
+ Profile page
+ Minimal Google Map implementation
    - Render map
    - Accept user points
    - Ajax call to save point
+ Points view
    - List/manage points
    - Add note to point

##  Master branch
Minimal implementation. As close to framework defaults and best practicies as possible.

## Branches
Contain the same framework with one particular library/technique different to the master branch, this is to highlight the particular extension, its strengths and weaknesses. 
`Framework-` + `Extension`
e.g. `Rails-Angular`, `Rails- Devise`, `Django-Angular`, `Angular-Firebase`
